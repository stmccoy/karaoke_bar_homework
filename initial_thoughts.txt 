could make a room class that all rooms inherit from to allow you to make a toilet, a smoking area etc. 

Any room with a bar creates a bar tab if person reaches zero then stops after a certain limit. 

make a person class that people could inherit from based on their preference for music genre. Gender to help with toilets. Cash to help with bar tab. 

make songs class that specific songs can inherit from, this will have a genre and name class as this will help with task. 

person  can woo if genre is right and cheer if song and genre is right

plan for tomorrow

create a room class
list of 3 genres and a None type (none type for toilets and check in etc)
staff 
room space
check in will check room space and add to queue for room if full
queue 


create a song class 
list of 3 genres
5 songs per genre

add song will check genres match room

checkin function in check in room:

check in process
punter to show id to bouncer 
punter to pay fee to checkin staff
checkin staff to assign customer to room or queue

add songs to rooms
if guest tab for karaoke turns gets too much make pay or kickout
